# calculator

## Bugs/Challenges

- i got it working with two numbers being operated on. now i need to completely change that code to accomodate for a larger amount of numbers

- i was able to make it mostly responsive though id like to adjust that height and width since currently it looks very squished

- id like to add a point so that you can create decimal numbers, if its possible.
